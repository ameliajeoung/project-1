        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>I moved to Philadelphia at 8 years old, essentially spending the majority of my formative adolescence there.</p>
        <p>I always knew I wanted to go out-of-state for college, but after my freshman year I was so happy to spend a few months at home. I've always loved it, but I gained a newfound appreciation for Philly after time away. </p>
        <p>More and more I find myself centering art projects around Philly.</p>
